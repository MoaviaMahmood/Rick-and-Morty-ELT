# Rick and Morty API Data Extraction

This project demonstrates how to extract, process, and store data from the Rick and Morty public API using Python. It is designed as a beginner‑friendly data engineering / data analysis task, showcasing API pagination handling, JSON processing, and basic data transformation with Pandas.

## Project Overview

The notebook fetches data from multiple endpoints of the Rick and Morty API:

Characters

Locations

Episodes

The extracted data is paginated, combined into a single dataset per endpoint, and saved locally in JSON format for further analysis or loading into databases.

This project is suitable for:

Practicing API data extraction

Understanding paginated REST APIs

Building a simple data ingestion pipeline

Portfolio demonstration for data engineering or analytics roles
